# Project Brief: Cline's Memory Bank System

## Project Overview
This project implements and maintains Cline's Memory Bank - a comprehensive documentation system designed to preserve context and knowledge across memory resets. The Memory Bank serves as Cline's external memory, enabling continuity and effectiveness in software development tasks.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. **Context Preservation**: Maintain complete project understanding across sessions
2. **Knowledge Continuity**: Preserve technical decisions, patterns, and insights
3. **Efficient Onboarding**: Enable rapid context restoration after memory resets
4. **Progressive Documentation**: Build knowledge incrementally through structured files

### Key Components
- **Hierarchical Documentation**: Core files that build upon each other
- **Structured Workflows**: Clear processes for Plan and Act modes
- **Dynamic Updates**: Documentation that evolves with project progress
- **Context Triggers**: Clear indicators for when updates are needed

## Success Criteria
- Memory Bank enables immediate project understanding after reset
- All technical decisions and patterns are preserved
- Documentation remains current and actionable
- System supports both planning and execution phases

## Constraints
- Documentation must be in Markdown format
- Files must follow the established hierarchy
- Updates must be triggered by specific events
- System must be self-maintaining and self-documenting

## Project Scope
This is a meta-project focused on implementing and refining the Memory Bank system itself. The system should be robust enough to support any software development project while maintaining clarity and usability.
