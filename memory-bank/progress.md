## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Session Start)
- **Empty Directory**: Started with completely empty project
- **Foundation First**: Begin with projectbrief.md as base
- **Sequential Creation**: Build files in dependency order
- **Complete Documentation**: Fully document each file upon creation

### Design Evolution
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Emerged as natural pattern for information flow
- **State Management**: activeContext.md and progress.md for dynamic tracking
- **Update Triggers**: Specific events that require documentation updates
- **Quality Patterns**: Built-in verification and consistency mechanisms
- **Version Control Integration**: Added requirement for git commits on task completion
- **Phased Development**: Added requirement for individual commits per development phase
- **Git Commit Timeout**: Added 3-second timeout handling for git commit operations
- **Git Status Verification**: Added requirement to execute git status after each commit

### Technical Decisions
- **Markdown Format**: Universal, readable, version-controllable
- **File System Storage**: Simple, reliable, no external dependencies
- **Tool Usage**: Sequential operations, complete file reading
- **Self-Documentation**: System documents itself during creation

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- **Untested**: System created but not yet tested with real projects
- **Single Session**: All work completed in one session, no reset testing
- **No Validation**: Haven't verified system works after memory reset
- **Usage Patterns**: Theoretical workflows, not yet proven in practice

### Potential Risks
- **File Size Growth**: Documentation could become unwieldy over time
- **Update Complexity**: Multiple file updates could become error-prone
- **Context Overload**: Too much information could slow down session starts
- **Maintenance Burden**: System requires discipline to maintain

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic system health checks planned
- **Size Management**: Monitor and manage file sizes
- **Process Refinement**: Improve workflows based on experience
- **Tool Optimization**: Streamline operations over time

## Success Metrics

### Achieved Goals ✅
- **Complete System**: All 6 core files created and documented
- **Clear Structure**: Hierarchical information flow established
- **Self-Documentation**: System documents itself comprehensively
- **Actionable Content**: Every section serves a practical purpose

### Pending Validation
- **Memory Reset Recovery**: Test system after memory reset
- **Context Restoration**: Verify rapid context loading works
- **Work Continuity**: Confirm seamless project continuation
- **Quality Maintenance**: Ensure consistent work quality across sessions
