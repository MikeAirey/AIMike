# Development Progress

## Completed Features

### Core Game Systems ✅
- Ball physics and collision detection
- Paddle movement (mouse and keyboard)
- Brick destruction mechanics
- Power-up system
- Particle effects
- AI adaptive difficulty system
- Sprint system for enhanced movement
- Multi-level progression

### Accessibility Features ✅
- Screen reader announcements
- Audio feedback system
- Keyboard navigation support
- Visual indicators for game state
- ARIA labels and proper semantic HTML

### Debug System ✅ (Latest)
- Left-side debug log panel with dark theme
- Comprehensive logging across all game systems:
  - System events, game state changes
  - Physics calculations and collisions
  - AI analysis and skill level changes
  - User input tracking
  - Audio system events
- Toggle-able debug panel via configuration UI
- Persistent debug settings (localStorage)
- Clear log functionality
- Auto-scrolling and limited history (100 entries)

### Layout & UI Structure ✅ (Latest)
- Fixed debug log layout issues - no longer moves main game window
- All UI components (except debug log) contained in central columnar container
- Debug log positioned as true overlay that doesn't obstruct main UI
- Restructured HTML with proper #mainContainer wrapper
- Enhanced debug panel styling with backdrop blur
- Removed layout-shifting margin logic from debug system
- Main game content remains perfectly centered regardless of debug panel state

### Configuration UI ✅ (Latest)
- Unified configuration panel at bottom of screen
- Debug controls section
- Audio controls section (moved from top)
- Sprint settings section
- Visual feedback for toggle states (green ON/red OFF)
- Organized layout with clear sections

### Game Rebranding ✅ (Latest)
- Renamed from "Intelligent Adaptive Brick Ball" to "speedball"
- Updated HTML title, headings, and in-game displays
- Maintained "Intelligent Adaptive Gameplay" subtitle

### UI Cleanup & Configuration Updates ✅ (Latest)
- Removed h1 element from HTML for cleaner layout
- Removed "Intelligent adaptive gameplay" subtitle from menu
- Removed "The AI will adapt to help you succeed" text from menu
- Made configuration section more compact with reduced spacing
- Ensured consistent styling across all configuration UI elements
- Updated default values:
  - Debug Log now defaults to ON
  - Audio remains defaulted to ON
  - Sprint Top Speed changed from 50 to 15

## Technical Improvements

### Code Organization ✅
- Modular ES6 architecture
- Proper separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Cross-system integration

### Performance Optimizations ✅
- Efficient collision detection
- Optimized rendering pipeline
- Memory management for particles
- Conditional debug logging (performance-conscious)

## Current Status
- All requested features implemented and tested
- Game fully functional with enhanced debugging capabilities
- UI cleaned up with more compact configuration section
- Default values updated for better user experience
- Ready for commit and further development

## Next Steps
- Commit current changes with descriptive message
- Consider additional debug categories if needed
- Monitor performance with debug logging enabled
- Gather user feedback on new debug features and UI improvements
