# Active Context: Cline's Memory Bank System

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Task
**Memory Bank Enhancement**: Adding git status verification requirement - execute `git status` after each `git commit` command for verification.

### Current Session Status
- **Session Start**: 7/17/2025, 10:23:26 AM (Australia/Perth)
- **Mode**: ACT MODE
- **Memory State**: Fresh start - no previous context
- **Directory State**: Empty project, creating memory-bank structure

### Immediate Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Create memory-bank directory structure
2. ‚úÖ Create projectbrief.md (foundation document)
3. ‚úÖ Create productContext.md (why and how system works)
4. ‚úÖ Create systemPatterns.md (technical architecture)
5. ‚úÖ Create techContext.md (technology context)
6. ‚úÖ Create activeContext.md (this file - current state)
7. ‚úÖ Create progress.md (status and evolution tracking)
8. ‚úÖ Verify complete Memory Bank system
9. ‚úÖ Document completion and usage instructions

## Recent Changes

### Files Created This Session
1. **memory-bank/projectbrief.md** - Project foundation and scope
2. **memory-bank/productContext.md** - User experience and workflows
3. **memory-bank/systemPatterns.md** - Technical architecture and patterns
4. **memory-bank/techContext.md** - Technology stack and constraints
5. **memory-bank/activeContext.md** - This file (current state)
6. **memory-bank/progress.md** - Status tracking and evolution

### System Verification ‚úÖ
- **All 6 core files present**: Confirmed via file listing
- **Complete documentation**: Each file fully documented and actionable
- **Proper structure**: Files follow established hierarchy and dependencies
- **Ready for use**: System prepared for memory reset testing

### Key Decisions Made
- **Documentation Format**: Markdown for universal readability
- **File Structure**: Hierarchical with clear dependencies
- **Update Strategy**: Triggered by events, complete file reviews
- **Core Files**: Six essential files for complete system

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Implementation Approach
- **Sequential Creation**: Building files in dependency order
- **Complete Content**: Each file fully documented on creation
- **Self-Documenting**: System documents itself as it's built
- **Immediate Usability**: Each file ready for use upon creation

### Design Principles Applied
- **Foundation First**: projectbrief.md shapes all other files
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Information flows logically between files
- **Actionable Content**: Every section serves a practical purpose
- **Consistency**: Uniform structure and formatting across files

### Technical Patterns Emerging
- **File Dependencies**: Clear information flow between files
- **Update Triggers**: Specific events that require documentation updates
- **State Management**: activeContext.md and progress.md track dynamic state
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in verification and consistency checks

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Documentation Standards
- **Structured Headers**: Consistent navigation and scanning
- **Clear Sections**: Logical information grouping
- **Actionable Items**: Use checkboxes for task tracking
- **Status Indicators**: Clear progress markers (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üîÑ)

### File Management Patterns
- **Complete Reading**: All files must be read at session start
- **Targeted Updates**: Use replace_in_file for small changes
- **Full Rewrites**: Use write_to_file for major changes
- **Verification**: Always verify changes after implementation

### Workflow Patterns
- **Plan Mode**: Read context ‚Üí develop strategy ‚Üí present approach
- **Act Mode**: Check context ‚Üí execute ‚Üí document changes ‚Üí commit changes ‚Üí git status
- **Phased Development**: Plan phases ‚Üí execute phase ‚Üí document phase ‚Üí commit phase ‚Üí git status ‚Üí next phase
- **Updates**: Review ALL files ‚Üí update relevant ones ‚Üí verify consistency ‚Üí commit updates ‚Üí git status

## Learnings and Project Insights

### System Design Insights
- **Memory Bank as Meta-Project**: The system documents itself
- **Hierarchical Information**: Foundation files rarely change, active files change frequently
- **Context Preservation**: External memory system enables continuity
- **Self-Improvement**: System gets better with each update cycle

### Implementation Insights
- **Tool Usage**: Sequential file operations work well for documentation
- **File Size**: Balance completeness with readability
- **Structure**: Clear hierarchy prevents information conflicts
- **Verification**: Reading back changes ensures accuracy

### User Experience Insights
- **Seamless Continuity**: Users shouldn't notice memory resets
- **Rapid Onboarding**: Complete context restoration in under 2 minutes
- **Consistent Quality**: Documentation maintains work quality across sessions
- **Progressive Learning**: System accumulates knowledge over time

## Context for Next Session

### If Memory Resets
1. **Read ALL memory bank files** in this order:
   - projectbrief.md (foundation)
   - productContext.md (why and how)
   - systemPatterns.md (technical architecture)
   - techContext.md (technology context)
   - activeContext.md (this file - current state)
   - progress.md (status and evolution)

2. **Understand Current State**: Memory Bank system is being created from scratch
3. **Next Task**: Complete progress.md file and verify system completeness
4. **Context**: This is the initial implementation of the Memory Bank system itself

### Current Environment
- **Directory**: /home/mike/src/ract/AIMike
- **Files Created**: 6 of 6 core Memory Bank files complete ‚úÖ
- **Status**: System complete and verified, ready for use
- **Mode**: ACT MODE - executing the Memory Bank creation task

## Pending Work

### Immediate Tasks
- [x] Create progress.md file
- [x] Verify all 6 core files exist and are complete
- [x] Document system completion
- [x] Provide usage instructions for future sessions

### Current Update: Git Status Verification ‚úÖ
Added new requirement to execute `git status` after each `git commit` command for verification. Updated systemPatterns.md and techContext.md to reflect this status verification requirement.

### Previous Update: Git Commit Timeout Handling ‚úÖ
Added new requirement that if a git commit command takes more than 3 seconds, stop waiting and continue as though it has completed. Updated systemPatterns.md and techContext.md to reflect this timeout handling.

### Previous Update: Phased Development Workflow ‚úÖ
Added new requirement that when tasks are broken into phases, each phase must be committed separately to git. Updated systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, and productContext.md to reflect this workflow enhancement.

### Recent Project: Speedball Game (100% Complete + UI Cleanup)
**Status**: All 7 phases completed + major refactoring + UI cleanup completed, each phase committed separately
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Setup & Basic Physics (committed)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Brick System (committed) 
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Game Loop & Lives (committed)
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: Power-ups (committed)
- ‚úÖ Phase 5: AI Performance Tracking (committed)
- ‚úÖ Phase 6: Gameplay Enhancements (committed - ENTER key launch, hidden cursor, multi-ball life system)
- ‚úÖ Phase 7: Ball System Refactoring (committed - unified array-based ball handling)
- ‚úÖ UI Cleanup: Removed h1, subtitles, compacted config, updated defaults (ready to commit)

**Latest Changes**: UI cleanup and configuration improvements:
- Removed h1 element and "Intelligent adaptive gameplay" subtitle
- Made configuration section more compact with consistent styling
- Updated defaults: Debug Log ON, Sprint Top Speed 15

**Demonstrates**: Successful implementation of phased development with individual commits per phase, plus major code refactoring and UI improvements

### Immediate Tasks
- [x] Update systemPatterns.md with phased development workflow
- [x] Update techContext.md with phase commit requirements
- [x] Update productContext.md with phase management workflow
- [x] Update activeContext.md with current enhancement
- [x] Update progress.md with this workflow enhancement
- [x] Commit Memory Bank enhancement with descriptive message

### Current Tasks
- [x] Update techContext.md with git status verification requirement
- [x] Update systemPatterns.md with git status patterns

- [x] Commit git status enhancement

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Test phased development workflow with complex projects
- [ ] Refine phase definition criteria and commit message standards
- [ ] Optimize file structure based on experience
- [ ] Enhance documentation based on patterns discovered
